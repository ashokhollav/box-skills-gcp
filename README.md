This guide demonstrates how to build a Box Skill application in Node.js using Serverless, a command line tool for building and deploying applications to serverless architectures, and the Box Skills Kit, a library for interacting with the Box API and integrate it with AI/ML services from Google Cloud !

## Setup

* Please follow instructions at https://cloud.google.com/vision/product-search/docs/quickstart to setup product search catalog on Google Cloud. Ensure you have a project in GCP and billing enabled !. 
* Follow instructions at https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/google/guide/installation/ to install serverless
* Follow instructions at https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/google/guide/credentials/ to create Google Cloud Service account and to give appropriate privileges to the service account.
* Download the private-key json file from Google Cloud and save it at secure location on your workstation.
* Clone the repo
```
      git clone https://github.com/ashokhollav/sample-google-product-search-integration
```
* Edit the serverless.yml 
  * update the project_id
  * update the location of your private key, downloaded earlier
* Edit the index.js file
  * update the code to reflect your project specific details in the parameters being passed for     productSearchClient.productSetPath(..)
* Install the dependencies
```
      npm install --save

```
* Deploy the function to Google Cloud
```
      serverless deploy
```
      
You can also follow instructions @ https://cloud.google.com/functions/getting-started/ to use google native tools.

* Follow instructions at https://developer.box.com/docs/build-a-box-skill and at https://developer.box.com/docs/configure-a-box-skill to build a Box skill app using Box's developer console and enable it using Admin Console.
* Ensure when you configure the app , you have the Google Cloud function endpoint URL at hand

### Things to note:
* If downloading the skills-kit library from https://github.com/box/box-skills-kit-nodejs/tree/master/skills-kit-library then replace the skills-kits-2.0.js in the library directory and make the following changes
  * You receive a JSON object instead of JSON string from Box to your Google cloud function, hence you will have to edit the line 131 in the skills-kit library 
      
 ```javascript
 from 
        function FilesReader(body) {
          const eventBody = JSON.parse(body);
          ....
      }
    
 to 
 
      function FilesReader(body) {
        const eventBody =body;
        ....
      }
  ```


## Google Cloud Vision Product Search:

Cloud Vision Product Search allows retailers to create a set of products, each containing reference images that visually describe the product from a set of viewpoints. Currently Vision API Product Search supports the following product categories: homegoods, apparel, and toys.

When users query the product set with their own images, Vision Product Search applies machine learning to compare the product in the user's image with the images in your product set, and then returns a ranked list of visually and semantically similar results.

The quickstart demonstrates how to create a product set which contains a group of products with reference images for those products. The quickstart shows users how to create a product set, products, and their reference images in a single step by batch import. After the product set has been indexed, you can query the product set using Vision Product Search.

We will use Product search api's within our cloud function, which gets triggered when a file is uploaded into Box.

## Use case:
You, a retailer, use Box for storing all your product  related data such as images. There are a lot of images to organize and you need a quick way to not only organize these datasets but also find out similar products, the max price of such products and other information.
You choose to create a ML powered product catalog in Google Cloud, which allows you to query visually and semantically similar items. Once you upload the data into Box, the custom skill that you've built will call the Google Cloud Product Search api - the catalog for which you;ve built already - The API returns similar product in your catalog and the category, price information.

## Workflow
* Upload an image file that represents a product, in this demo we use the one of the images from gs://cloud-ai-vision-data/product-search-tutorial/images/ or a similar image sourced from the internet into your Box drive
* The upload triggers a Box skill event workflow, this calls the Google cloud function previously deployed and configured in Box Admin Console.
* The Cloud Function does the following
  * Use the Box skills kit's FileReader api to read the base64 encoded image string
  * Call the product search api that we previously configured
  * Create a Topics Card with data returned from the product search API
  * Create a Faces card to create an icon based on the image
  * Persist the skills card with Box using skillswriter api.
      
* You open the image in Box drive and click on the "skills" menu (a wand like icon on the right)
* Product catalog information, with similar products and max price is populated - powered by Cloud Vision Product Search API from Google
